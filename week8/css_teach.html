        <p>Before you begin to learn css,make sure that you've already learned the HTML,if not,please learn HTML first.</p>

        <h2><br>What is CSS?<a href="../week10/cssStyleLearning.html">[CSS STYLE]</a></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>HTML is Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
            <li>Solving the problem of separation of content from expression</li>
            <li>Cascading Style Sheets can greatly improve work efficiency</li>
            <li>External style sheets are usually stored in CSS files.</li>
            <li>Multiple style definitions can be cascaded into one.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><br>The problem which has solved.</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The HTML tag was originally designed to define document content. By using tags like < h1 >, < p >, < table >,
                the original intention of HTML is to express "this is the title", "this is the paragraph","this is the form" and so on.
                At the same time, the document layout is done by the browser without any formatting tags.</li>
            <li>After the two major browsers (Netscape and Internet Explorer) continue to be the new HTML tags and attributes
                (such as font tags and color attributes) added to the HTML specification, create the document content clearly
                is independent of the document presentation site becomes more and more difficult.</li>
            <li>To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the nonprofit Standardization Alliance,
                has undertaken the HTML standardization mission and created (Style) beyond HTML 4.
                All mainstream browsers support cascading style sheets.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><br>Improve work efficiency</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The stylesheet defines how to display HTML elements, just as the font tags and color attributes of HTML 3.2 do.
                Styles are usually stored in external.Css files. By simply editing a simple CSS document, the external stylesheet
                enables you to change the layout and appearance of all the pages in the site at the same time.</li>
            <li>By allowing simultaneous control of the styles and layouts of multiple pages, CSS can be a breakthrough in the WEB
                design field. As a web developer, you can define styles for each HTML element and apply it to any number of pages
                you want. If you need a global update, simply change the style, and all elements in the site are automatically updated.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><br>Cascaded into one</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Style sheets allow you to specify style information in a variety of ways. The style can be specified in a single HTML
                element, in the head element of the HTML page, or in an external CSS file. You can even refer to multiple external
                style sheets within the same HTML document.</li>
